## Usage

Need the env var `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### quick start

`cd ./doc-generater-demo`

then 

`go run . ../demo-server/main.go registerRoutes2`

### go generate

after build the excution file. 

`cd ./demo-server/`

then 

`go generate  ./...`

this will only generate `func registerRoutes() {}`

### output

```
doc for endpoint /health:
Endpoint: GET /health

Summary:
- Lightweight liveness check. Confirms the service is running by returning a 200 response with the body "OK".
- Only the HTTP GET method is allowed. Any other method returns 405 Method Not Allowed.

Behavior details:
- Method handling:
  - If the request method is not GET, the handler responds with:
    - Status: 405 Method Not Allowed
    - Body: "Method not allowed"
  - If the request method is GET, the handler responds with:
    - Status: 200 OK
    - Body: "OK"

Request:
- No request body or parameters are required or used.
- No authentication or headers are required.

Response:
- Success (GET):
  - Status code: 200
  - Body: OK
  - Content-Type: Not explicitly set by the handler. In Go’s net/http, it will typically be inferred as text/plain; charset=utf-8.
- Error (non-GET):
  - Status code: 405
  - Body: Method not allowed

Side effects:
- None. The endpoint is read-only and idempotent.

Intended use:
- Health/liveness checks by load balancers, orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), or monitoring systems. It does not perform deep dependency checks—only indicates the server process is responsive.

Examples:
- Successful health check:
  - curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
  - HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  - OK
- Incorrect method:
  - curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/health
  - HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  - Method not allowed
  
doc for endpoint /products:
Human-readable documentation for /products handler

Overview
- productsHandler is the single entry point for both the collection endpoint (/products) and item endpoints (/products/{id}).
- It delegates to specific handlers based on the HTTP method and the path:
  - getProductsHandler
  - createProductHandler
  - getProductByIDHandler
  - updateProductHandler
  - deleteProductHandler

Routing behavior

1) Collection endpoint: /products
- GET /products -> getProductsHandler
  - Intent: return a list of products.
- POST /products -> createProductHandler
  - Intent: create a new product.
- Any other method on /products -> 405 Method Not Allowed
  - Response body: "Method not allowed or endpoint not found"

2) Item endpoints: /products/{id}
- GET /products/{id} -> getProductByIDHandler
  - Intent: return a single product by ID.
- PUT /products/{id} -> updateProductHandler
  - Intent: update a product by ID.
- DELETE /products/{id} -> deleteProductHandler
  - Intent: delete a product by ID.
- Any other method on /products/{id} -> 405 Method Not Allowed
  - Response body: "Method not allowed for product ID endpoints"

How the path is interpreted
- The handler first checks for exact matches:
  - Exact "/products" with GET or POST go to the collection handlers.
  - Exact "/products/" with GET/PUT/DELETE is treated as an item route (see “Trailing slash quirk” below).
- If those exact matches don’t apply, it falls back to a generic rule:
  - It treats any path that has characters after the "/products/" prefix as an item endpoint and routes by method:
    - GET -> getProductByIDHandler
    - PUT -> updateProductHandler
    - DELETE -> deleteProductHandler
    - Others -> 405 with the item-endpoint message above
  - The segment after "/products/" is considered the “ID.” There is no validation here (e.g., numeric), so validation is expected to occur in the called handlers.

Error responses produced directly by this handler
- 405 Method Not Allowed with message "Method not allowed for product ID endpoints" when an unsupported method is used on an item path.
- 405 Method Not Allowed with message "Method not allowed or endpoint not found" when an unsupported method is used on the collection path.
- All success responses and more specific errors (e.g., 400/404/500) are produced by the delegated handlers.

Notes and edge cases
- Trailing slash quirk: A request to exactly "/products/" (with no ID) is treated as an item endpoint and dispatched to:
  - GET -> getProductByIDHandler
  - PUT -> updateProductHandler
  - DELETE -> deleteProductHandler
  This likely results in downstream validation errors because no ID is present. Use "/products" (without a trailing slash) for collection operations.
- Prefix assumption in fallback: The generic fallback assumes the path starts with "/products/". If a request path begins with "/products" but not with "/products/" (e.g., "/productsXYZ"), the code may still treat the remainder as an ID and route to item handlers, which can be surprising. In normal usage, stick to "/products" or "/products/{id}".

Quick examples
- List: GET /products -> getProductsHandler
- Create: POST /products -> createProductHandler
- Retrieve: GET /products/123 -> getProductByIDHandler
- Update: PUT /products/123 -> updateProductHandler
- Delete: DELETE /products/123 -> deleteProductHandler
- Not allowed:
  - PATCH /products -> 405 "Method not allowed or endpoint not found"
  - POST /products/123 -> 405 "Method not allowed for product ID endpoints"
  
doc for endpoint /products/:
Overview
The productsHandler routes HTTP requests under the /products base path to specific handlers based on the HTTP method and whether an ID segment is present after /products/.

Supported endpoints
- GET /products → getProductsHandler
  - Purpose: list or retrieve all products.
- POST /products → createProductHandler
  - Purpose: create a new product.
- GET /products/{id} → getProductByIDHandler
  - Purpose: fetch a single product by its ID.
- PUT /products/{id} → updateProductHandler
  - Purpose: update a product by its ID.
- DELETE /products/{id} → deleteProductHandler
  - Purpose: remove a product by its ID.

Routing logic details
- Exact path matches:
  - Path exactly "/products" with GET routes to getProductsHandler.
  - Path exactly "/products" with POST routes to createProductHandler.
- ID detection for /products/{id}:
  - Any path that starts with "/products/" and has additional characters after that prefix is treated as having an ID segment.
  - For such paths, the method determines which by-ID handler is called:
    - GET → getProductByIDHandler
    - PUT → updateProductHandler
    - DELETE → deleteProductHandler
- Trailing slash nuance:
  - The code contains cases for r.URL.Path == "/products/" paired with GET/PUT/DELETE and comments suggesting they “catch” /products/{id}. In practice, a literal equality check to "/products/" will not match "/products/123".
  - Actual dynamic ID routing happens in the default branch, which checks for any non-empty segment after "/products/".

Error handling and status codes
- If the request path is /products (no ID) with a method other than GET or POST:
  - Responds 405 Method Not Allowed with message: "Method not allowed or endpoint not found".
- If the request path is /products/{id} (an ID is present) with a method other than GET, PUT, or DELETE:
  - Responds 405 Method Not Allowed with message: "Method not allowed for product ID endpoints".
- No other explicit 404 handling is shown; unmatched cases in this handler result in one of the above 405 errors.

Path parsing behavior
- ID presence is inferred by checking if r.URL.Path has any characters after the "/products/" prefix.
- The actual extraction and validation of the ID (its format or numeric parsing) is presumed to be handled inside getProductByIDHandler, updateProductHandler, and deleteProductHandler.

Notes and assumptions
- Request/response payload formats, validation, and status codes for success/failure of the sub-handlers are not shown in this snippet.
- No query parameter handling is defined here; routing is entirely path- and method-based.
- Authentication/authorization, if any, is not shown in this code.

Example requests
- List products: GET /products
- Create product: POST /products with a JSON body (e.g., product fields)
- Get by ID: GET /products/123
- Update by ID: PUT /products/123 with a JSON body
- Delete by ID: DELETE /products/123
```
